<h2>About Us</h2>

  About Me<br>
My name is Max Billings, and I started Yellow Jacket Lawn Care with a passion for hard work, attention to detail, and helping people take pride in their outdoor spaces. What began with just a mower and a few neighborhood lawns has quickly grown into a professional business built on reliability and quality. I take pride in treating every yard as if it were my own, making sure my clients know they can count on me week after week.
