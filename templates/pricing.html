        <h2>Routine Lawn Care</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weekly lawn maintenance:</strong> Keep your lawn sharp with consistent, reliable mowing at the right height for healthy turf. Even if it's too hot, wet, or dry we can still come by and edge the property, clean the yard of debris, and blow off all walks, patios, and driveway.</li>
            <li><strong>Edging & Trimming:</strong> Crisp, defined edges along sidewalks, driveways, and flowerbeds. String trimming around fences, trees, and other hard-to-reach spots ensures a neat, uniform finish across your entire lawn.</li>
            <li><strong>Blowing & Cleanup:</strong> After mowing and trimming, we blow clippings off all paved areas — leaving your property spotless and ready to enjoy.</li>
            <li><strong>Weed Control in Beds & Borders:</strong> We keep flowerbeds, mulch areas, and fence lines tidy by tackling weeds before they get out of control.</li>
            <li><strong>Shrub & Hedge Care:</strong> Routine pruning and shaping help your shrubs and hedges stay healthy while adding curb appeal with a clean, polished look.</li>
        </ul>
